# Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning with Disaster Tweets

This is a Deep Learning project where we categorize tweets as referring to a Disaster or Non-Disaster.

# Data Processing

The data as taken from the kaggle website consist of keywords, location, and the text of the tweet, so the majority of the Data Processing was focused on the text. We used common Natural Language Processing Techniques such as Stop word and Puncuatioon Removal, lower-casing letters, two and three bag-of-words, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency, and Sentiment Analysis. 

# Modeling

Our aim for this project is to test several types of Algorithms, both deep learning and non-deep learning, to determine which one is the best. Overall, our Recurrent Neural Network performed the best.
